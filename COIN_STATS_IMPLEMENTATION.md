- `/ethstats` - Detailed Ethereum analysis

## 📊 Output Format Example

```
Price: PEPE $0.000013 (+11.50%) ▲

Market Summary: Pepe is trading at $0.000013, up 11.50% in the last 24 hours. With a daily volume of $8.81B and a $5.45B market cap (Rank #25), the memecoin is seeing renewed momentum and heightened trading activity.

Technicals:
- Support: $0.000011
- Resistance: $0.000015
- RSI (72): Overbought → caution advised
- 30D MA: Price above MA → bullish signal
- Volume ($8.81B): High → strong liquidity
- Sentiment: Bullish → fueled by price spike + volume surge

Price Performance:
- 1h: +2.15%
- 24h: +11.50%
- 7d: +34.20%
- 30d: +89.45%

Forecast (24h Outlook):
Pepe shows strong upward momentum, but RSI in overbought territory suggests a possible short-term pullback. A retest of support is likely before another push toward resistance. Volume confirms continued interest, but profit-taking could trigger volatility.

Bot Signal (Next 24h): 🟠 HOLD → Bullish trend intact, but near-term upside may be limited due to overbought conditions.
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### RSI Calculation
- Uses 14-period RSI with proper gain/loss averaging
- Provides overbought (>70), oversold (<30), and neutral interpretations

### Support/Resistance Detection
- Analyzes recent price history (last 20 periods)
- Identifies key levels based on historical highs/lows

### Trading Signal Algorithm
- Multi-factor scoring system considering:
  - Price change momentum
  - Volume levels
  - RSI conditions
  - Moving average position
- Generates clear BUY/HOLD/WATCH/SELL signals

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API timeouts
- Coin symbol search and matching
- Fallback values for missing data
- Clear error messages for users
