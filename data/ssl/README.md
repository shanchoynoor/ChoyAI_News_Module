# SSL Certificate placeholder
# This directory will contain SSL certificates when HTTPS is configured
# For now, nginx will only run on HTTP (port 80)

# To add SSL certificates:
# 1. Place your SSL certificate here as server.crt
# 2. Place your private key here as server.key
# 3. Update nginx.conf to include SSL configuration

# For Let's Encrypt certificates, you can use:
# certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
